# vimrc

Finally, try to organize my vim life.

The aim is to have a "nice" vim experience that is portable from desktop/laptop to servers. Getting the trimmings, like youCompleteMe and Ag to work well out of the box on remote systems will be the challenge.

I probably have to set up a seperate repository for building vim, ag, git, etc.
